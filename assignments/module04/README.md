## Description

This directory (*module04/*) contains all of the code written for assignment4. All code was written targetting armv7l and tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B running Raspbian 11. The problems are enumerated as follows:

**4-1.** Ask user for their name/age and print
**4-2.** Print string with tabs in it
**4-3.** Print string with quotations in it  

## Build Instructions

For the purposes of this course, I will include pre-built binaries in the remote repo, so this step should not be necessary. If for some reason they must be rebuilt, simply execute the following commands in a bash shell:

```bash
chmod 755 build.sh
./build.sh
```

## Run Instructions

Simply execute each of the binaries in the *bin/* directory. For example on a Linux machine:

```bash
./bin/problem4-1
./bin/problem4-2
./bin/problem4-3
```

Each binary should print out an example input-output sequence to the active terminal.
