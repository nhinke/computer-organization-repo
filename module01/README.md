## Description

This directory (*module01/*) contains all of the code written for assignment1. All functions were written using C++11 and were compiled into binaries using g++ 7.5.0. The problems are enumerated as follows:

**4a.** Implement toLower() and toUpper() functions  
**4b.** Convert binary string to hex string  
**4c.** Convert decimal integer to hex string  
**4d.** Convert ASCII string to decimal integer    

## Build Instructions

For the purposes of this course, I will include pre-built binaries in the remote repo, so this step should not be necessary. If for some reason they must be rebuilt, simply execute the following commands in a bash shell:

```bash
chmod 755 build.sh
./build.sh
```

## Run Instructions

Simply execute each of the binaries in the *bin/* directory. For example on a Linux machine:

```bash
./bin/problem4a
./bin/problem4b
./bin/problem4c
./bin/problem4d
```

Each binary should print out an example input-output sequence to the active terminal.
